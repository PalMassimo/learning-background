# Complete Guide to Elasticsearch

## Introduction
**Elasticsearch** is an open source analytics and full-text search engine. It is easy to use and highly scalable.
It is written in java and built on top of **Apache Lucene**. 

In elasticsearch data is stored as _documents_, as rows in a relational database. A document's data is separated into _fields_, as columns in a table. A document is a simple json

```json
{
    "firstName": "foo",
    "lastName": "bar",
    "interests": ["golf", "tennis"]
}
```

### Querying Elasticsearch
The way we interact with elasticsearch is through rest apis.
